# TrimApp-PhotoEditing

This project simulates photo editing which includes features to crop or apply a colour filter to an image.
This uses a bitmap image (bmp) for the processing. The choice for crop includes landscape and portrait modes, on the other hand
the choice for filter includes two colors namely violet and green. 

The project is coded in older versions of C++ supported by Turbo C++.
